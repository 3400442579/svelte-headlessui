# Svelte-HeadlessUI

`svelte-headlessui` is an unofficial implementation of [Tailwind HeadlessUI](https://headlessui.com/) for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). Just like the official implementation, they are:

- ✅ Completely unstyled
- ✅ Fully accessible UI components
- ✅ Fully types with Typescript
- ✅ Designed to integrate beautifully with Tailwind CSS

But also:

- ✅ Designed to integrate beautifully with Svelte and SvelteKit
- ✅ Less than 14kB minified / 4.5kB minified gzipped

## Alternative

You may be interested in evaluating [@rgossiaux/svelte-headlessui](https://svelte-headlessui.goss.io). This package aligns closer to the official components in it's approach although I believe that approach (driven by React / Vue) contributes to the [larger size of 173kB minified / 29kB minified + gzipped](https://bundlephobia.com/package/@rgossiaux/svelte-headlessui@1.0.2).
