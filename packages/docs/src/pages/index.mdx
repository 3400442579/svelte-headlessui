# Svelte-HeadlessUI

`svelte-headlessui` is an unofficial implementation of [Tailwind HeadlessUI](https://headlessui.com/) for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). Just like the official implementation, they are:

- ‚úÖ Completely unstyled
- ‚úÖ Fully accessible UI components
- ‚úÖ Fully types with Typescript
- ‚úÖ Designed to integrate beautifully with Tailwind CSS

But also:

- ‚úÖ Designed to integrate beautifully with Svelte and SvelteKit
- ‚úÖ Less than 14kB minified / 4.5kB minified gzipped

## Alternative:

You may be interested in evaluating [@rgossiaux/svelte-headlessui](https://svelte-headlessui.goss.io). This package aligns closer to the official components in it's approach although I believe that approach (driven by React / Vue) contributes to the [larger size of 173kB minified / 29kB minified + gzipped](https://bundlephobia.com/package/@rgossiaux/svelte-headlessui@1.0.2).

This is the `docs` starter template. It contains all of the features that you need to build a Markdown-powered documentation site, including:

## Getting Started

To get started with this theme, check out the `README.md` in your new project directory. It provides documentation on how to use and customize this template for your own project. Keep the README around so that you can always refer back to it as you build.

Found a missing feature that you can't live without? Please suggest it on Discord [(#ideas-and-suggestions channel)](https://astro.build/chat) and even consider adding it yourself on GitHub! Astro is an open source project and contributions from developers like you are how we grow!

Good luck out there, Astronaut. üßë‚ÄçüöÄ
